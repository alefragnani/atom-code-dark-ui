# Code Dark UI theme

> Following Atom archiving in December 15, 2022, this package will be archived as well. Learn more in their [official announcement](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/)

A dark UI theme mixing **Atom Dark** and **Visual Studio Code** elements.

Works great with my [Code Dark Syntax theme](https://atom.io/themes/code-dark-syntax) :smile:

## Features

* The Status Bar occupies the entire bottom of the window, not only the editor, and has the same colors
* The Tooltips are gray
* The Filename was removed from the status bar
* The Command Palette list and matching characters follows the VSCode colors
* The Code Folding is always on

## Support

While **Code Dark UI** is free and open source, if you find it useful, please consider supporting it.

I've been working on this on my spare time, and while I enjoy developing it, I would like to be able to give more attention to its growth.
