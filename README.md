# Code Dark UI theme

A dark UI theme mixing **Atom Dark** and **Visual Studio Code** elements.

I created this theme mostly to unify my `styles.less` file that contained a few visual tweaks. And with **Visual Studio Code** launch, I  decided to apply some elements that I enjoyed, in **Atom**. So here it is :)
