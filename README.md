# Code Dark UI theme

A dark UI theme mixing **Atom Dark** and **Visual Studio Code** elements.

I created this theme mostly to unify my `styles.less` file that contained a few visual tweaks. And with **Visual Studio Code** launch, I  decided to apply some elements that I enjoyed, in **Atom**. So here it is :)

## Features

* The Status Bar occupies the entire bottom of the window, not only the editor, and has the same colors
* The Tooltips are gray
* The Filename was removed from the status bar
* The Command Pallete list and matching characters follows the VSCode colors
* The Code Folding is always on
